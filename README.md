## Details About the project
I have used many popular libraries to built this project and I have listed them above as you can see. <br/>
So I will start with the styling of the application. I have used  **React Styled Components** for styling. It is very simple and easy to use as it breaks down a big component in multiple smaller component which is relatively easier to style. <br/>
Next for state mangement of the application I have used another popular library **React Query**. It makes the global state management of the app very simple and also it makes the UX of the application better by preloading certain datas ahead of time to give users a smooth experiance. <br/>
The routing of the application is handled by **React Router**. <br/>
Now for the backend of the application I have used **Supabase** which is an alternative of firebase. This is very easy to implement and perfect for this small scale application.
